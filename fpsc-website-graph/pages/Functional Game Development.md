- While functional programming is making huge inroads in areas like web development and distributed computing, there is one kind of software where its use is still rare: games. The vast majority of games today, from the small indie variety up to triple-A titles, are written in a mostly standard way, filled with mutable variables and large object hierarchies.
-
- Zach walks you through writing games in a functional programming language that features:
  
  * easier debugging
  * game recording
  * rewinding
  * live-reloading
  * making changes while playing
-
- All in [[ClojureScript]], a functional language that runs in web browsers, and play-cljs, a game library written for it.

- This event was [generously hosted by the College of Charleston's Computer Science Department](http://compsci.cofc.edu/).
