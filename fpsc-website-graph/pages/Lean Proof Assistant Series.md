- [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/about/) is a functional programming language with a highly expressive type system. It can be used to produce performant programs that are **guaranteed** to meet their specifications, meaning that a large class of bugs cannot exist in your program. It is also used to interactively prove theorems in mathematics.
-
- This Summer 2024 Series is for enthusiasts to join together to learn, code, and share their experiences with Lean.
