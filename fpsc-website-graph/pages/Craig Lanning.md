- Craig Lanning has been been developing large, complex, object-oriented applications in Common Lisp since 1985. This development has been performed in Lisp environments running on Symbolics Lisp Machines, Texas Instruments Lisp Machines, VAX Lisp, Franz Allegro on Unix, LispWorks on Windows, Linux, and Unix, and SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) on Linux. 
  
  He was involved in the International Standards Organization (ISO) standards since 1992 and has worked on many Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects.  Particularly the implementation of a RETE based rule engine  and acquisition of the knowledge to drive rule-based decision support systems.
  
  Standards:
  
  * ISO 10303-210 - AP 210, Electronic assembly, interconnect, and packaging design
  
  Patents:
  
  * US2014/0245374A1 - Device and Method for Detection of Anomolus Behaviour in a Computer Network
  
  Projects:
  
  * [Express Engine](https://sourceforge.net/projects/exp-engine/) - STEP (ISO 10303) development environment which supports the validation of STEP data populations via EXPRESS (ISO 10303-11) schemata and the transformation of STEP data populations from one schema to another via EXPRESS-X (ISO 10303-14) schemata.
  * [STEP CAD Tools](https://sourceforge.net/projects/step-cad-tools/) - Collection of tools for allowing CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems to interact with STEP (ISO 10303) data.
  * [STEP Toybox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/step-toybox/) - STEP ToyBox is a project which develops various small applications for processing EXPRESS (ISO 10303-11) schemas and/or STEP Part 21 (ISO 10303-21) data files. Some are command line only while others are GUI based.
