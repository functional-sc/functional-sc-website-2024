- Nobody cares about your productivity ....sometimes.
-
- While Functional Programming techniques and technologies are powerful tools that significantly enhance productivity, delivering high-quality code requires **different design goals** than just maximizing output.  Productivity in terms of sheer volume is sometimes less critical than fulfilling other design criteria like security or safety and reliability. In certain contexts, like high-risk or critical industries, optimizing for factors beyond just development speed or quantity of delivery is the key objective.
-
- Hence in many industries, personal productivity is a secondary priority to:
	- security
	- safety & reliability
	- regulatory compliance
-
- In these contexts, the focus shifts from development output to different real-world demands.
-
- For example:
	- **Aerospace, Automotive and Autonomous Vehicle** is where [[safety]] and regulatory [[compliance]] are critical. 
	   Especially in applications for avionics, flight systems and military-grade software. These systems undergo extensive testing and verification, making productivity secondary to stability and safety.
	- **Healthcare and Medical Devices** is where [[accuracy and reliability]] are crucial. Software errors in diagnostic equipment can be life-threatening so precision and regulatory adherence outweigh the speed of development.
	- **Financial Services and Banking** is where [[security]] and regulatory [[compliance]] are often prioritized over productivity. Financial institutions handle sensitive customer information and breaches or errors can lead to significant financial and reputational losses.
-
- Functional Programming can certainly help in with those categories.
