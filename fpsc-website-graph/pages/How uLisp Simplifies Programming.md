-
- In this workshop, we’ll introduce you to the world of uLisp, a streamlined version of the LISP 
  programming language tailored for microcontrollers. You’ll learn how to connect and program a NeoTrinkey - a compact powerful device with built-in lights and keypads from your Android phone, Chromebook or laptop.
-
- This session will guide you through basic control of the NeoTrinkey’s features even if you're unfamiliar to LISP or microcontroller programming.
-
- Plus, for just $5, you’ll receive your own NeoTrinkey and all the accessories you need to get started!
-
- **Note: does NOT work with an Apple phone!**
