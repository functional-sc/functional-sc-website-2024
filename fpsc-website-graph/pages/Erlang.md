- ### Business Rationale
- Erlang is known for its superior handling of concurrent and distributed systems its design ensures **high availability, fault tolerance**, and scalability, allowing for efficient load management and **uninterrupted service**. Its lightweight process model and message-passing architecture enhance system performance and reliability, while its functional programming paradigm promotes **maintainable and bug-resistant code**.
-
- ### Developer Rationale
- For a software developer, Erlang is **designed for concurrent and distributed systems**. Its lightweight process model and built-in message-passing mechanism make it exceptionally well-suited for applications requiring high concurrency and fault tolerance. The language's **immutable data structures** and functional programming approach lead to more predictable and reliable code, reducing the risk of bugs and easing debugging. Erlang’s ability to handle **real-time systems** with its **hot code swapping** feature means developers can upgrade systems without downtime, a critical factor for high-availability applications.

- ### Key Industries and Businesses
	- **WhatsApp** - One of the most famous examples, WhatsApp uses Erlang to handle its messaging infrastructure, enabling it to manage 900 million users with low latency, high reliability and with a team of 50.
	- **Ericsson** - As the originator of Erlang, Ericsson uses it extensively in its telecommunication systems, particularly for real-time applications in mobile networks and telecommunications infrastructure.
	- **Discord** - Discord uses Erlang to support its large-scale chat service, ensuring real-time messaging and voice communication for millions of users with minimal downtime.
