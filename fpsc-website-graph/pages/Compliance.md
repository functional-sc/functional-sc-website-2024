- [[Regulatory Compliance]] often requires software to adhere to stringent standards for data integrity, security and auditability. Functional programming emphasizes immutability, strong type systems and predictable behavior which are well-suited for building compliant systems especially in highly regulated industries. Here are some languages known for supporting regulatory compliance efforts:

	-
	- [[Haskell]]: Haskell’s type system enforces strong data integrity constraints which are essential for regulatory compliance. Its immutability and pure functions minimize side effects, making it easier to create audit trails and comply with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA. Haskell’s ability to encode business rules in types also enables modeling of compliance logic.

	- [[F#]]: As part of Microsoft's .NET ecosystem, F# benefits from their regulatory compliance support programs. F-Sharp's functional programming features such as immutability and type safety, reduce the likelihood of non-compliant behavior ensuring predictable and traceable code execution. F# is used in the finance and insurance sectors, where regulatory compliance is essential, and its compatibility with .NET allows it to easily integrate with compliance monitoring tools.
	-
	- [[Scala]]: Scala, particularly in the context of the distributed computing framework of Apache Spark, is widely used in industries with strict regulatory requirements. The combination of functional programming features (e.g., immutability) and compatibility with big data tools enables organizations to build data pipelines that comply with regulations like GDPR. Scala’s support for types and functional purity ensures data consistency and traceability,  key to regulatory reporting and audit trails.
	-
	- [[OCaml]]: OCaml’s strong type system and immutability make it easier to implement systems that comply with strict regulatory requirements. Its pattern matching and data validation capabilities allow for complex business logic, such as financial rules, to be encoded and verified at compile-time, minimizing runtime issues that could lead to non-compliance. OCaml is often used in finance, where regulatory adherence is a top priority.
	-
	- [[Erlang]]: Erlang’s reliability and process isolation model make it a good fit for telecoms and other regulated industries which require high availability and resilience. Its functional programming approach, along with fault-tolerant design allows for predictable behavior, essential for compliance with telecom and emergency standards.
	-
	- [[Lean]]: The Lean Theorem Prover aids in compliance by providing a formal framework to verify systems adherence to regulatory and industry standards. Its proof mechanisms ensure that critical software components meet required specifications reducing the risk of non-compliance.
