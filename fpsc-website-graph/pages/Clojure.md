- ### Business Rationale
- Clojure stands out for its strengths in concurrency, functional programming and **seamless integration with the Java Virtual Machine** (JVM). If you're building modern, scalable applications then Clojure is a strong contender.  Its expressiveness and **productivity-boosting features** allow for **fast development** and easy adaptation making it an excellent choice for businesses focused on creating reliable and maintainable software.
-
- ### Developer Rationale
- Clojure delivers a powerful mix of **functional programming principles** in an impressive **concurrency** model, perfect for high-throughput, data-centric applications. Its concurrency model simplifies managing large volumes of concurrent tasks through **immutable data structures** and **software transactional memory (STM)**, ideal for environments requiring scalability such as web services and high-throughput data processing systems.
-
- By focusing on **immutability guarantees** and providing a concise, consistent syntax, Clojure promotes predictable and maintainable code. This approach to immutable data structures and functional paradigms facilitates safer parallelism and simplifies reasoning about state thereby reducing bugs in complex concurrent environments.

- ### Key Industries and Businesses
	- **Nubank** - One of the largest digital banks in the world, based in Brazil, heavily relies on Clojure for its backend systems to handle millions of financial transactions and customers.
	- **CircleCI** - A continuous integration and delivery platform that uses Clojure in the majority of their codebase to help build and deploy software.
	- **Netflix** - Netflix uses Clojure in parts of its infrastructure, especially for automation and backend services supporting streaming operations. They have released Map-Reduce for Clojure.
