- For [[Accuracy and Reliability]], functional programming languages offer strong type systems, immutability, and predictable and error-resistant code. Here are some of the best choices for accuracy and reliability, particularly for applications demanding precision and stability:

	-
	- [[Haskell]]: Haskell's strong, static type system catches many errors before the code runs. With immutability and pure functions, it's easier to understand and predict how the code behaves, minimizing unexpected changes. The type system also allows for precise rules, leading to more reliable software.
	-
	- [[OCaml]]: OCaml combines functional and imperative features, making it particularly versatile for building complex, reliable systems. It is frequently used in financial and trading applications (e.g., at Jane Street) due to its emphasis on type safety and pattern matching which helps to enforce business logic and avoid runtime errors.
	-
	- [[F#]]: This language, part of the Microsoft .NET ecosystem, provides the rigor of functional programming within an industrial-strength framework. Its support for type providers enables real-time data verification and validation, which is ideal for data-intensive applications requiring high accuracy, such as scientific and financial applications.
	-
	- [[Erlang]]: Built for telecom systems, Erlang emphasizes concurrency, fault tolerance, and "let it crash" resilience. Its process isolation model and support for distributed systems make it ideal for high-availability applications where reliability is critical, such as telecommunications and messaging systems.
	-
	- [[Scala]]: Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms making it well-suited for data processing and distributed computing tasks requiring reliability and accuracy. Its functional aspects, such as immutability and type safety are ideal for large-scale data applications that prioritize accuracy.
	-
	- [[Lean]]: The Lean Theorem Prover ensures accuracy and reliability by allowing developers to formally verify mathematical proofs and logical assertions, minimizing errors in complex systems. By automating proof validation, Lean enhances the integrity of software, particularly in critical applications.
