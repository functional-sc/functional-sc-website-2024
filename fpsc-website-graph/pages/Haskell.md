- ### Business Rationale
- The Haskell programming language offers several key benefits, its strong type system ensures that many common **errors are caught during the development process**, leading to more reliable code. Its focus on functional programming, where functions avoid side effects and operate in a predictable manner, makes the code **easier to understand and maintain**. Additionally, Haskell's ability to handle complex tasks and manage multiple processes efficiently can lead to more **scalable and high-performance applications**.  Businesses can develop software that is dependable and easier to work with while handling demanding requirements.

- ### Developer Rationale
- Haskell is a great choice due to its emphasis on functional programming principles and **strong type safety**. Its **purely functional nature** ensures that functions are predictable and free from side effects, making code easier to reason about and debug.  Haskell programs are known to work "the first time" after successful compilation.
-
- The language’s advanced type system, including features like **type inference** and algebraic data types, helps catch errors early and leads to more reliable code. Haskell’s support for **lazy evaluation** also allows for efficient handling of potentially large data structures and complex computations. Additionally, its **concurrency model** enables developers to build highly performant applications that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

- ### Key Industries and Businesses
	- **GitHub** - GitHub utilizes Haskell for various internal tools and services.
	- **JPMorgan Chase** - JPMorgan Chase employs Haskell in financial services and trading systems. The language’s ability to handle complex algorithms makes it a valuable tool in the banking and finance industry.
	- **Facebook** - Facebook uses Haskell in some of its backend services for tasks such as spam management, data analysis and infrastructure.
