-
- Compilers are tools typically used to create binary we call software. Kenneth Miller has some interesting thoughts on extending the metaphor (and tools) to both human and programming languages.
-
- After a brief introduction of existing compiler technology, Kenneth discusses his ideas that include:
  
  * type checking natural languages
  * probabilistic type inference
  * an algebra for linguistic analysis
-
- Leading to some interesting tools and conclusions.
  
  This event is generously hosted by The Iron Yard Charleston.
