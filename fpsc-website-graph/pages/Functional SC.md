-
- Functional Programming is style of crafting software that allows programmers to create **simpler software** for complex problems, saving you money and time.
-
- We advocate for all functional programming technologies, in many standard programming languages or with one tailored for it such as: [[Haskell]], [[Clojure]], [[F Sharp]], [[Erlang]], [[OCaml]] and more.
-
- Based in historic Charleston, South Carolina we are open to all to learn and explore technology.
