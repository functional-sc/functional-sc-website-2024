- Thanks to core features like immutability, strong type systems, and predictable behavior, functional programming languages inherently reduce [[security]] vulnerabilities by limiting side effects and making code more reliable and easier to reason about.  These languages enforce constraints that prevent many common security issues such as unintended data mutations and unchecked type errors leading to more secure applications. Here are some of the best programming language options for a security-focused approach to software development:

	-
	- [[Haskell]]: Haskell is known for its strong type system helping to catch errors at compile time, reducing runtime risks. Its immutability and pure functions are ideal for building secure and reliable systems. Haskell's monads do allow for controlled side effects helping to maintain security.
	-
	- [[OCaml]]: OCaml's strong type system, along with its focus on immutable data structures and pattern matching, contributes to secure code by preventing many common bugs and vulnerabilities. OCaml is used by organizations like Jane Street, known for their high-security trading systems, due to its ability to ensure correctness.
	-
	- [[Erlang]]: Originally designed for telecom systems, Erlang focuses on concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed systems. Its "let it crash" philosophy isolates failures, making it resilient against system faults. Erlang's immutability and process isolation help prevent data leakage and improve overall security.
	-
	- [[F#]]: Part of Microsoft'sal .NET ecosystem, F# combines functional programming principles with a strong type system. Its immutability and powerful type inference are valuable for building secure applications, especially within industries requiring high compliance standards. F# is well-suited for secure financial and scientific applications.
	-
	- [[Clojure]] and Lisp: Although not inherently secure, Lisp-based languages like Clojure focus on immutability and concurrency contributing to secure, reliable applications. Clojure, in particular, is suited for systems requiring data consistency across distributed environments.

- Each of these languages contributes to security in its way, whether by reducing runtime errors, enforcing immutability, or supporting formal verification methods that can protect critical infrastructure and sensitive data.
