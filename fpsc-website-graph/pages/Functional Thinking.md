- Concepts of functional programming is made much harder when the developer is also trying to learn a new language, like [[Haskell]], Scala or [[Clojure]] at the same time. With that in mind, we focus on relating functional concepts in a common language: Java.
-
- There is a video presentation intended for technical and semi-technical alike. Although programming techniques are discussed, semi-technical audiences can fully appreciate the the rationale and flexibility of functional programming.

- Take aways from this presentation:	
  * Think about results, not the steps.
  * Immutability over state transitions.	
  * Results over steps.
  * Composition over structure.
  * Declarative over imperative.
