-
- As a long-term software developer, author and contributor to many development books, Heow Goodman firmly believes that functional technologies such as Lisp and [[Clojure]] are required for unlocking our full potential.
-
- Creating software is his passion and premier career choice rather than simply a stepping stone on the way to management.  His personal goal is to condense centuries of productivity into the mere decades of a human lifespan.
  
  Goodman is a founding member of Functional SC and principal organizer for a decade at [LispNYC](http://www.lisp.nyc).
